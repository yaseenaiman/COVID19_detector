# COVID19_detector
A deep learning algorithm using Colab and Tensorflow to predict whether or not a person has COVID-19 by uploading his/her CT scan 

The accuracy achieved in this model is 80%, we are aiming to achieve about 90% as we are working on that.

The content of this folder is constatly changing cuz we are improving the model.


This folder contains:


1- The COVID-19 dataset identifers and labels in this file covid_data.csv in the data folder, so do not change the images names, use them directly.


2- The algorithm "end_to_end_COVID_19_Diagnosis.ipynb"


You should create the followng folders in your drive:


1- images: Training and validation pics. I could not uplaod the pics cuz of the file size, you just need to use the link below to download the images and upload them directly to the images folder, you might need to make all of them in png extension

2- logs and models separately you will understand them when you run the code


3- Test: contains the test pics, upload them directly
