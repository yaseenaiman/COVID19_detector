# COVID19_detector
A deep learning algorithm using Colab and Tensorflow to predict whether or not a person has COVID-19 by uploading his/her CT scan

The accuracy achieved in this model is 75%, we are aiming to achieve about 90% as we are working on that.

The content of this folder is constantly changing cuz we are improving the model.
The data (images) has been taken from this paper
https://paperswithcode.com/paper/covid-ct-dataset-a-ct-scan-dataset-about#code

This folder contains:


1- The COVID-19 dataset identifiers and labels in this file covid_data.csv in the data folder, so do not change the images names, use them directly.


2- The algorithm "end_to_end_COVID_19_Diagnosis.ipynb"


3- images: Training and validation pics. And also test pics provided by the research paper mentioned above.


4- logs and models separately you will understand them when you run the code


5- Test: contains other test pics, upload them directly if you have some(I provided you with some pics taken from Iraqi hospitals).
